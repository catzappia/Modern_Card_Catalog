# Modern_Card_Catalog
A book search using Google Books API.

## Description

- I want to preface this by noting that the render site is not working as the build keeps failing (there is an error in the node_modules/render src folder thats generated for the project).
- I've tried to read the documentation for this error thats online but I can't figure out whats breaking it. I am getting together with someone this week/end to go over how to fix it and why its occuring so the link should be running in a few days.
